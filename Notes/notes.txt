// Notes for me 

Web Development = Client + Server + Database


// Now we have see the client and server already

// Database
// Now there are lots of database out there in the market, we can use accroding to our need

1. SQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. MongoDB ( NO SQL)
4. MariaDB
5. Oracle

// Database typically have their  own server systems to manage and provide acess to the data they store.

// These database server systems are separate from nodejs server but work together to create dynamic and data-driven web applications

// NODEJS SERVER AND DATABASE SERVER

A Database server is as specialized computer program or system that manages databases. it stores, retrieves and manages data efficiently.

the database server stores your application data, when your nodejs server needs data . it sends requests to the database server which then retrieves and sends the requested data back to the Nodejs server.

NODEJS server is responsible for handling the HTTP requests from clients ( like web browsers) and returning responses

Nodejs server process these requests , communicates with the database server and sends data to clients
